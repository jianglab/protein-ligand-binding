# Multi-protein Ligand Binding
It is common for a ligand to bind to multiple proteins with different affinities. For example, a drug can bind its true target with a high affinity and many off-targets with weaker affinities. Here, we have developed a web app that can help you simulate these situations by plotting the fraction of the proteins in the bound state for any number of proteins, concentrations, and binding affinities.
